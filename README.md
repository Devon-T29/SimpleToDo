## Notes

I encountered a few errors while installing the app and creating the virtual device but those were easily fixable. I only encounter one problem while coding and that was when I was using the "FileUtils" function class & the functions in the class were not recognized. After doing research I found that the import command automatically added by android studio is outdated and does not contain the correct functions. I found the correct import command which was "import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;" and everything worked as it should after that.
